Here's a collection of story themes where I talk about meta-narrativistic themes that come up in the story.

The reason that I'm including as it's own section is so I'm able to make sure that the themes are interspersed throughout the piece and therefore no theme ends up becoming to immediately obvious or too "in your face". 

The idea of a [frame narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_within_a_story) - Where the [[Story Locations#^967662|Pine Winter Zone]] is used as a framing device for the main novel. Is this similar to a cliched [[Movies#^e61409|13th Floor]]? 

**The importance of signs** - Signs, literally and metaphorically, are important throughout the novel. 

**Action** - There are some action sequences in the story which includes sex scenes. The action scenes should include an element of risk. It should be rare that if there's something bad that happens in the story that no one gets hurt, as otherwise this would be boring.

**Drugs** - How they can be used and how they can be misused and how this relates to the concept of free will. ^44bbca

**The importance of religion** - Religion is considered important because when most are confronted with their own mortality they have to believe in some sort of idea. 

**Engineering aspects of space** - The importance of engineering aspects in space.

**The unexplained** - There will be several things/events in the novel which won't be explained. The Great Pluto Disaster, in which [[Story Locations#^14f472|Pluto]] was destroyed won't be explained. These will be events which just "happened" and shows that neither the characters nor the narrator are omniscient. The limit of knowledge?

**World building** - World building as it applies to both the sci-fi and the fantasy worlds and what this means. 

**There are good people out there** - The idea being that there are people that will band together from disparate backgrounds, even people at odds with one another in order to fight a common enemy.

**A happy ending**  - There should be a happy ending.

**Space travel (as it relates to culture and money)** - One of the central conflicts in the story is that people are attempting to find out how the Gates work and at the same time they're attempting to find out how the [[Technologies#^eb2958|entrephauna]] works. To what extent does this then make this a detective novel where the main plot point isn't the major story arch?

**Finite resources both within human space and with human beings** - One of the themes of the story is how people deal with finite resources in their decision making, how they find friends, and how other forces such as politics and religion end up influencing people. 

**Free will and personality** - This is a big one and maybe the central theme of the entire novel. Each of the characters is influenced by their jobs, their religion, existential (literal) threats to their existence, and the question then is how are these characters such that they have their own personality? 
	How is this related to free will in space where everyone is to some extent specialized, or where people have to join groups in order to survive? 
	How does this related to free will as it applies to drugs? 
	How is this related to if someone goes through a sundering and becomes a Gestalt, or if someone suddenly wakes up one day and finds out that they're an Android? 
	In other words, how are these people free and what does it mean to be free? 
	How does this relate to notions of what it means for there to be privacy in such circumstances as overcrowding where everyone is living in close proximity to one another?

**Use of language as it applies to time and space** - I don't know how to deal with this one. How should I change the language between groups of people in order to show that the narration is changing to reflect their own self consciousness? Should I do first, or third person perspectives?

**Homecoming** - One of the perpetual themes of the book is the idea of home coming - coming home from a long journey in which someone is far away and must go there and come back ([[Books#^59d024|see Tolkein]]). Each group has their own idea of home coming and what that means and so have their own ideas about what should happen and why. It's a kind of separation or fracture and then coming together again - similar in spirit to how the androids have a map and the gestalts have a sundering.
