Emi Oliri fell down the port hole of the space port as the signs and smells of ozone drifted up her and tunnelled up through her right. A sign blares in iridescent Illus-Ory WELCOME TO STATION POINT ZERO[[Cliches#^37be9d|1]]  as she corkscrews in a slow spiral down past the joe-boys hooking claws into bulkhead straps next to the three bloodied knives piercing a heart of the Order of the Spear.

- What are your coordinates bunny?
- Yeah, uh, what's your umm you know your uh tra-ject-ory?

Fuckwad one and fuckwad two, slackjawed hunks of raw vat grown flesh that are wirejacked to an inch of their lives. You need someone to growl over a piece of clone protein, bark, and rip someone's face off then these are some primo Valentinos right here.

She smiles big white teeth that don't manage to reach up to her eye flesh tumbles around and plants two feet on a bulk head and with a "ta ta" changes her fall so the station leaves these two to spend the rest of the cycle comparing steroid injector ports.

She falls past the parlor trick area of the local Gestalt thera - I mean theorists, with the emphasis on local and trick. There was a Martian couple on their first trip up well (wearing hats they were wearing big floppy hats with brims! were they expecting rain?) watching an acrobat attempt to convince them that he could predict the future by floating a ring of Tarot cards in a circle. She carefully floats past lest her compression suit knock one of his, but she still here's a "hey" behind her. 

She was working here. She had enough cycles in the well to qualify as a courier, and she was trustworthy enough as a courier running between ships that she could make it off Phobos Station. She was counting the cycles and reaction mass and she nearly had enough. She was 22 and had come up in the drip levels of the entric tributary of colony four, far down in the trench where environmental recyclers melted into stalactites from the constant accumulating moisture. She had seen not a couple of her creche mates go from creche to ultraviolet quarter of the floating fans and climb back to creche again on bent knee only to spawn again. That wasn't to be her fate. If Saturnalia 234 could fall in flames from into a red sky she could climb a ladder to Phobos, and then away. 

She'd been on the seven kilometer wide station for six months and had traversed all of the quarters of Phobos. [[Story Set Pieces#^8a013d|I should describe the space station Phobos.]] She'd sat on one privy council leading to a spacing (air and water theft), she'd delivered packages where her map knew she shouldn't ask, but smelled of off-world genetics or home grown ammunition. She didn't bunk in a crater dome, but lived in an interior section far enough away from the periphery not to worry about cosmic rads and she was getting her shots and her rad checks, no matter the creds. Slow consistent burn fell out of gravity wells, damn skippy. 

Her stomach growls as she passes a Baphomet grotto smelling of barbecued meats roasting on a spit drizzled over by temple whores, no telling how much that was clogging the air recyclers. She counted her credits and considered her options. Her job was a simple one, to exist in a world of high G burns and elliptical curves and make straight lines from one station end to another. But she had to eat. Not like she was about to convert to the animal collective mind. She bounced off a bulk head and reoriented velocity towards a dandelion collection of heads all converging on a spheroid bar. 

She comes into the bar and there's the usual collection of losers and low orbit low life's hanging about. Also it's cheap. It's not an outplanet group but she knows some of the dock workers and someone had gotten the baphomet drunk again. Which is good for a laugh and for free drinks. Who would hire an baphomet with a drinking problem is anyone's guess, but Rosa has been running the ball for as long as anyone can remember. She floats up to the bar and hooks her suit into an available rung. She looks up and spots Geogio with a smile. 

- Georgio my man with a plan, you owe me money. More importantly you owe me a favor.
- Ah damsel, that is not the case. You do me a disfavor with so ill a greeting. 
- You always say that which is why I like you. 
- The feeling is mutual. Which is of course why I must of course pay my debt. I would feel, what is the word, uncouth to do so otherwise. Oonneh Expodite Volocitae brunmana.  

Georgio floated a roll of credits across the bar to Rosa who flipped a beer bulb across the table with an off hand gesture. She caught the beer in surprise and when she looked up there was only bulkhead where Georgio's withered face had been. Georgio didn't owe her money and she didn't ask after what Georgio did for his. They weren't syndicate partners. Just one of the rare people in her life that didn't have an air/water/power heads up in her goggles. She unconsciously touched the ultra-reflective surface of her newest ones on her forehead and fought the urge to bring them down and scan everyone in the bar. Like that would be a good idea.

She covered and started face hopping behind a pull of her beer. [[Cliches#^1c6fb2|(scene is a potential cliche)]]

She pulled up each one of the profiles one at a time in her mental inventory. There were a couple of out of system spacers, with cheap bulky suits that overlayed planet side without enough pneumatics to do anything useful, not to mention it'd be a pain in the map to push them in and out of an airlock. There were a couple of young dock workers she knew, but they were busy either coming on shift or off with the usual ass grabbing, griping and elbow digging. She hallo'd to a couple, and was hallo'd in return, but it all looked stable spin to her.

Ok, at this bar she has to meet up with two of her friends that are doing something for some reason. 
And then, since Phobos is so close to the surface of the planet they have to get her involved in a jumper initiation. Which involves jumping from one planet to a satellite and back (which is strictly speaking incredibly dangerous) after taking [[Technologies#^048b05|trang]]. And then the satellites start speaking to her which is how she finds out that she's an AI? Ok, so the two friends have to be jumping with her - and then one of them has to think that they're an AI and isn't and the third is just along for the ride. One of the other characters that ends up calling a ship.
