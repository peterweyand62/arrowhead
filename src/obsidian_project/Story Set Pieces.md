These set pieces are explanations of physical structures or areas that are where the scene takes place. Each of these pieces says something about the scene, but aren't as large as, say, a [[Story Locations]]. Each of the pieces in the novel should say *something*, specifically, because in space everything is important. Inside the fantasy construction of the [[Story Locations#^967662|Pine Winter Zone]] this world is mediated from the point of view of someone who has spent their entire life in space, so even a sky that goes to a horizon is considered somewhat mystical.

Their job was to to know things and to predict that that percentage would happen into the future. The table was flat, oblong, a nondescript [[Technologies#^2236c5|plastisteel]] gray, and more importantly, exists in an undisclosed location that happens to have one gravity. Think underground villainous layer, but in space.
