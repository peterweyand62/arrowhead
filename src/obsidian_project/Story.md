Here is all the parts of the stories that I've written so far. To the extent that I can I'm going to be writing them all down and then seeing if I can form a cohesive whole. From all the parts I'll be able to come up with a story that's worth writing about in a single narrative. 

Let's see if we can start a story, with a setup problem. I understand that writing this story from a collection of Obsidian notes can be considered a bit of a [[Cliches#^2d9ebe|cliche]]. 

This is super important - [[Past Writing Fragments]]. Past writing will be folded in, or used for sections of the main story.

# Here is all of the world building exposition

Here's the list of [[Characters]]. 
Here are the settings [[Technologies]].
[[Spaceships]] is it's own category distinct from technologies because it's so large and important for the setting. 
There are also [[Story Themes]]. 
Here are [[Story Locations]] and [[Story Set Pieces]]. 
Here's a [[Story History]] of the science fiction elements of the story. 
There's a section on [[Story Linguistics and Slang]] I may not have a use for.
And then there are [[Story Critique Notes]]. 

# Here is all of the writing

Notes and ideas for story scenes are [[Story Scene Notes]].

## This writing is the main story entry point - 
## [[Table of Contents]] 

All of the writing in the table of contents is in chronological order! How chapters are sectioned will be taken care of later, but every link is in the correct order.
