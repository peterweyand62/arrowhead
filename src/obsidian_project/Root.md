This is the root file. This is the starting point of this graph web. I don't know where this is going, and I've attempted this before. If I just write out as much as I know then at some point I'll be able to find an original thought, some narrative that will make sense in this collection of random thoughts. The purpose here is to come up with something that is wholly my own, a contribution, something that will be worthwhile.

Here is the [[Story]] that I've been working on, on and off for the better part of I don't know how long. 
Here are some [[Ideas]]. Philosophy as such is wrapped up in this section, so there won't be a philosophy page.
Here are the [[Houses]] that I am aware of.
