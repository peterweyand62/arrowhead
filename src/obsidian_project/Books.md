	Revelation Space - Haven't read. 
	Chasm City - Haven't read. Similar to Wes Anderson movie Asteroid City? Avoid, as I don't like the plot - see cliches. There needs to be a happy ending.
	Most of this guys stuff is dark and blah. Yeah, his books are *shit*.

Robert Anton Wilson
	This book is used as a test to determine if someone can take drugs or is allowed to be able to exist on their own - see the use of numerology and then how he makes fun of the caballah (not the kaballah like a k - ie joke) - in order to distract someone and make them bad at math - Prometheus Rising ^087459
	Here's a question on how Prometheus Rising relates to [[Books#^72d4c5|Harry Potter]]. To what extent are each of the houses in Harry Potter related to each of the circuits in Prometheus Rising? 
		Hufflepuff - Type 1 Circuit
		Griffindor - Type 2 Circuit
		Ravenclaw - Type 3 Circuit?
		Slitherin - Type 4 Circuit? ^dfec37
