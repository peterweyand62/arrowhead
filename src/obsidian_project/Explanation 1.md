For a number of practical reasons, the primary method of space station creation is to excavate an existing moon in orbit. It's trajectory is known and the inside can slowly be converted into living quarters and life support systems protected from cosmic radiation. Further, inter-Syndicate treatise in regards to ecological nativism following the Great Pluto Disaster emphasizes protecting established orbits of celestial bodies whenever possible. This method of converting moons to space stations is to use craters as foundation areas for domes and structures while being careful to maintain the mass of the moon, building on top of concavities with the same mass that was excavated from the interior. Craters are useful because they're protected on several sides from radiation, while still provide an area open to the space for incoming light, which is useful for greenhouses, energy collection, and communications.
