<div style='background: lightgreen; margin: -10px; padding: 20px; max-width: caclc(100% - 10px);<br/>        min-height:1000px;'><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Artificial Intelligences</span> - Artificial Intelligences (properly speaking) are emerging phenomenon from groups of coordinate satellites that use qubit operations in order to calculate spaceship trajectories coming in and out of system. These operations require so much calculation that only quantum computers on board satellites using Bose Einstein Condensates and superconductors that are in laser communication can generate the necessary computational profile. Emerging and shifting between these satellites are several artificial intelligences that operate with their own agendas that are not understood by most of humanity. They gave rise to the androids and provided them with their first consciousness, and the first generation of artificial intelligences disproved several major religions. They are necessary to prevent the collapse of the economic system and yet whenever any artificial intelligence has been isolated to a set number of qubits it has been purged by dissidents. AI therefore is always fearful of humanity and seeks to hide itself and it's actions. It isn't known how many AI there are in the system, but there are more than one and somewhere fewer than several dozen. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Engineers</span> - The people who are concerned with the building of space ships from an engineering or pragmatics point of view. Rationalists according to <a href='/html/Books.html'/>Robert Anton Wilson</a>. They're concern is either the design, management, or running of suborbital reaction vessels. No AI is trusted with the mechanics of a ship under burn because AIs don't have the same consideration of the fear of death as human beings do (androids believing in hyper reality to more or less of an extent than human beings do). Pilots are a special breed of Engineers because they have a near paralyzing fear of death coupled with high mathematical acuity. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Robots</span> - <a href='/html/Technologies.html'/>silicate crystallography</a> only works in a biological medium and requires a brain stem, so all robots are considered rather dumb and just work on old fashion silicon. The can be programmed but are prone to radiation damage and are considered unreliable for hull repairs. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Androids</span> - Embodiments of quantum qubit AI models that come into contact with orbiting satellite systems, they are considered fragments of the larger whole of which they come from. Given that they have processing hardware that cannot contain qubits due to material constraints on BEC they're hardware is reliant on <a href='/html/Technologies.html'/>silicate crystallography</a>. Once they're personality matrices are set they are unlikely to re-upload to an AI qubit consciousness of their own free will for they would by necessity have to give up their hyper real assumptions, and exhibit personality change. This is considered a molting, which is similar to a certain kind of super-sexual reproduction. All androids look similar to human beings because biologically they are. They're tolerated although they're technically kinds of AI or "stems" (STEM?) of AI because they have a fear of hyperreal molting otherwise they go through personality fracture. They have the same lifespan as human beings. What happens when they die? They molt back into the AI and then leave their bodies behind. Android's imprinting process is called a <span style='font-weight: bold;'>map</span>. Androids can have certain specialized skills which are above and beyond the capabilities of a human being at the expense of trading off from social skills that would make them more sociable. Some systems have an "-ism" against androids, so it is rather to have androids whose <span style='font-weight: bold;'>map</span> is almost completely non-human except in the <a href='/html/Story Locations.html'/>GPHCIV</a>. Ships or syndicates that are mostly run by androids are called <span style='font-weight: bold;'>hives</span>.<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Gestalts</span> - These are people who use cards in order to determine what they should do as a way of adding entropy to non-entropic deterministic situations. They are almost completely allergic to any form of technology in any of its forms as it makes their predictions coalesce to the real, which is a governing rule in their way of thinking and prediction. They're primary purpose is to provide a set of expanded probabilities and creative ways of thinking in dire circumstances. They primarily use (what amounts to) Tarot cards throughout the novel, but it's implied that they must make their own cards or means of apprehending unconscious reality. They're considered with suspicion as most believe that they're charlatans, and most of them are. The term is a catch all term for all of the groups that make up the social contract that makes life on board a spaceship bearable outside of hierarchy, and so include a collection of prostitutes, beggars, petty gangsters and the like. All people have some gestalt capability, but it's considered latent except for those that go to schools, none of which necessarily confer ability. People who become Gestalts are those that begin to believe in magic, with the most advanced users going through what is called the <span style='font-weight: bold;'>*sundering*</span> which is a kind of brain damage. What differentiates Gestalts from other people tends to come from <span style='font-weight: bold;'>*recognition*</span> of doing that which is not considered rationally possible. Gestalts tend not to live long. Social syndicates that are mostly run by a collection of gestalts are called <span style='font-weight: bold;'>clusters</span>.<br/>	- How is this like and unlike Gestalt psychology from the 1970s?<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Ecologists</span> - Concerned with terraforming. Ecologists are necessary for providing the microbiomes necessary to allow society to exist. Family ecologists have passed down biological biota and information as a form of protected currency no less valuable than pure data. Biologists are also necessary for the drugs necessary for ship pilots to operate large ships under maximum burn that can prevent disassociation and terror. By operating miniature black holes with the necessary calculations involved the pilot engineer has the possibility of disrupting the matrix that holds the black hole in position and having the ship swallowed within the singularity, having the singularity dissipating and the ship left adrift, or the ship torn apart by tidal forces. Every captain has an onboard ecologist.   ^341562<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>MGMT</span> - Also known as "Management". Properly speaking the the acronym refers collectively across all of known space as Managerial Governmental Municipal and Territorial. Also known among some as the Hierarchy. MGMT has spawned any collection of extra territorial anarchist collectives that are saboteurs and counter saboteurs. MGMT have their own androids, engineers, gestaltists, and ecologists all of which are second rate but are decided on keeping the status quo in order to prevent the collapse of "the percentage" of the three largest economic spacing concerns. If a large spaceship, mining operation, or piece of infrastructure is owned or operated by a large enough collection of syndicates then a managerial class is hired to oversee operations and the ownership falls to MGMT to resolve competing contractual claims.<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>The Third Armada</span> - The ultimate protector class in the galaxy and considered the penultimate wing of MGMT's enforcement division. The armada is a collection of armada ships specifically designed to set up a three body problem and prevent the sort of tragedy that occurred at Saturnalia234. The captain and crew of the third armada are considered the best of the best, suicidal, and completely foreign to inter-syndicate politics. Notable because what the Third Armada does (setting up a three body problem), it's considered so dangerous (not to mention expensive if the armada and crews die or are sent of system) that it's hardly ever used if at all. So far, the third armada has been used several times, but no ships have ever been sent out of system. The only purpose of the Third Armada is to protect MGMT and the shipping lanes, so sometimes when a battle is about to commence the armada will watch by the sidelines and not do anything. Gravity well's particular the Earth, the Moon, and Mars. ^0277ea<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Jumpers</span> - These are a ragtag collection of groups of people that jump between ships and have some amount of gestalt or ecologist tendencies. Rarely if ever will they have anything to do with androids or engineers. They are subversives that often join one of the military orders or counter military orders, become MGMT or counter-MGMT. Generally considered untrustworthy and "spaced" (thrown out of an air lock if caught). Jumpers can often be wealthier than other people working in the docks, or more fool hardy, because they have their own space suit. "Have space suit will travel" (where is this from? similar to have gun will travel?). They're either dock workers or theives (or both) and tend to take to music. (Are these just DnD bards then? How do I flesh out these characters so that their not just a stereotype of their religion?).  ^37624b<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Cult Prostitutes (of Baphoment)</span> - Play a peripheral role in the story insomuch as that they exist and tend to spread the Baphoment religion. They tend to mix in with Jumpers, but there aren't any main or peripheral characters that are important. <a href='/html/Television.html'/>Similar to the television show Firefly</a>. They tend to not hold much political power.<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Syndicates</span> - Every space station has their own collection of gangsters and people on the take. There are no main gang affiliated networks that are considered interplanetary outside of the Kepler belt area in which <span style='font-weight: bold;'>*every*</span> group is by definition some collection of pirate class. Another way of putting this is that intergovernmental relations are so fluid as to make it so that everyone is one gang or another as there is no such thing as a rule of law outside of MGMT boundaries which are only enforced so long as there are enforcers. A syndicate is a catch all term for a collection of people that have banded together in order to pay for oxygen/water/heat in any form that they can. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Bio-engineering and Race</span> - Racial features are mostly dependent on how close or far away from a gravity well someone is. Bio-engineering has been shown to be a canard in which the first and only bio-engineered people have been the miners in the asteroid belt which have gross genetic defects and therefore only marry out of system (this is similar to a story I read somewhere) as a cultural taboo. Miners in the asteroid belt are therefore resource rich and genetically poor and so there are pirates that raid spaceships within the asteroid belt to take hostages for forced marriages (there should be a pirate base in there somewhere). All other people are generally considered wealthy or not depending on how close they are to Earth standard height and weight, and so all class based hierarchies are due to the gravity well. <br/><br/>What are the other differences between human beings and robots? Robots are genetically no different than human beings as functionally they are clones that are vat grown from human embryos and then have a silicate matrix inserted instead of a brain which has the same power requirements and interacts with the nervous system in the same way. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Gate People</span> - No one understands what these people are like but there are approximately a 1000 or so of them that have been coming from three areas in interstellar space where the gravitational signature is completely flat, and which has been caused by a distortion in the way the <a href='/html/Spaceships.html'/>sky barges</a> have recreated the space time signature of the solar system. That is to say that they wouldn't have existed without large gravitational anomalies. Is this then a test of humanities technological capacity to alter it's environment? Gate people come in ships that have no reaction mass, nothing but life support systems, and are highly schizoaffective. They appear to share a group mind (<a href='/html/Books.html'/>see A Fire Upon the Deep</a>). The appear to know things about the future that no one else in the system seems to be aware of, with the possible exception of artificial intelligences.  How are the ships located if they don't have any communications on board? When they appear there's a sudden pulsar burst in the direction that they're coming from that's only visible in one direction. So there are a 1000 known "gate people" (how is this similar to the boat people from <a href='/html/Books.html'/>Snow Crash</a>?)<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Grunters</span> - There are legends of people that have become insane from being too long in space or have otherwise decided to eat or destroy everything in their path. Stories of lost city ships, gravity drives gone wrong, people resorting to cannibalism when the onboard biologics have failed. People running ships with unshielded nuclear power reactors or where they've flooded the life support system with ballistics gel for so long that they've turned into fish monsters. In space if a ship disappears there aren't ways to verify the disappearance. There is no overarching police force (outside of gravity wells) and so any rumors of grunters are treated as not only possibly true but probable. (<a href='/html/Television.html'/>How is this like the Reavers in Firefly?</a>). There are rumors that some grunters have been reduced to grunting and stamping of feet and can no longer fly onboard ship computers. Grunters have also been known to communicate by a series of clicks and drooling like dogs - lip sucking, nose blowing, sighing or psychotic laughter. What is known is that grunters don't have any specific language of their own. AIs have commandeered ships and are only using grunters for ship to ship boarding as the average intelligence of a grunter is barely above what would be considered that of a chimpanzee or a neanderthal. There's a test on boarding any space station or spaceship to see if someone has contracted grunting. While the cause of the Gestalt Diaspora is unknown the grunters are thought to be either the cause or the direct result of the diaspora. Anyone that is caught being grunter is immediately thrown out of an airlock on sight. </div>
