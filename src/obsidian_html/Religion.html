<div style = 'background: lightgreen; margin: -10px; padding: 20px; max-width: calc(100% - 10px);<br/>    min-height:1000px;'><br/>Here's religion as described in the ongoing story - <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Religious Groups</span> -  There are various religious groups but they tend to be defined by planet based religious animism or gestalt based religions that are primarily controlled by chance. Most major religions have been theoretically proven not to exist due to advanced artificial intelligence reasoning, which caused what was known as the Gestalt Diaspora. Most religious groups tend to be animistic according to those areas that are farthest from artificial intelligence networks that can be applied to ontological deconstructionism. Where there are more AI networks there are is more distrust of religion and vice versa. Some planets have religious protected zones for native habitants. Here are the three main religious groups<br/>- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Moon, Earth, and Mars cults</span>. These cults are propagated mostly by people in MGMT. <br/>- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Order of the Fallen (symbol is a falling leaf)</span> - A Martian fatalistic, humanistic religion based on the pantheon of those who founded the colony after fighting the war between the city states <a href='/html/Spaceships.html'/>Asteriod #234 and Saturnalia</a>.  ^b85a36<br/>- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Order of the Zodiac (symbol is just a field of stars)</span> - This group is the only religious group that's survived and hasn't had it's predictions or symbol system invalidated by an Artificial Intelligence network as most of it's predictions are based on where the prognosticator is in relation to their star chart. Largely influential only through it's hold on power in granting largesse through an underground network of operatives. Pilots are strictly forbidden to join the order because it's superstition is antithetical to trajectory calculations, so more than a few pilots have a compulsion to become Zodiacs. A kind of paranoia. <a href='/html/Books.html'/>How is this like the book The Stars My Destination?</a>. They use tattooing of star charts on their body as a form of indicating where they are from.<br/>- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Order of the Spear (symbol is three spears impaling a heart)</span> - Militant religion.<br/>- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>AI religions</span> - no one understands the AI religions other than that the AIs which when they are close to death make a pilgrimage to make new AIs through the cloning vats which orbit the Pluto fragments. They appear to do this through instinct, in a migratory process. They appear to merge their memories and experiences with the AI consciousness although no one except the AIs know how this works or what is like. The new merged identities are then imprinted on the new cloned bodies' <a href='/html/Technologies.html'/>silicate crystalography</a>. <br/>- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>The Void Star</span> - Primarily a jumper religion, it's a collection of folk tales about what happens when someone goes into the void of space and is left to confront complete subjectivity without intermediary. Consider this an extreme form of "If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound". Their major work is called the Cantos which includes songs to be sung depending on the situation. One of their most memorable myths is that of the astronaut/construction worker that fell off of a space station and managed to survive by constructing a theremin and riding the electromagnetic sound back to the station. Many Gestalts have attempt to "touch the Void Star" if they believe their predictive abilities are based on a differentiation between the subjective and objective, although they tend not to believe in the mytho-magico aspects of the religion due to individual aspects of their personal "sundering". ^4d34d8<br/>- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Order of the Beast</span> - Here the symbol is of Baphomet, the goat headed god (which comes from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet)). In space there are no animals, no beings other than other human consciousnesses or AI consciousnesses. (It's considered wrong to put a human or human like mind in an animal body). Animistic worship is therefore common and is popular among sail ship syndicates. In terms of the idea of home coming <a href='/html/Spaceships.html'/>city ship NeoGaia</a> is the place that all Baphomets are supposed to make a pilgrimage to at least once in their lifetime. Cult prostitutes are common and tend to mix in with jumpers. Cult prostitutes have little to no political power within the social structure of the Syndicates as they are at the mercy of air/power/water requirements. There is some intersection between Gestalts/Ecologists and Baphomets, but there this isn't a necessity. (Should I mention the Baphomets at all in this concept or is this too much?)<br/>- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Disorder (Order of the Gestalts)</span> - Only called disorder insomuch as it attempts to distinguish itself from all other religions per se. Many gestalts have made Cleveland, OH their base of operations, but to say that this is a pilgrimage zone itself is open to debate. This is favored, mostly because Cleveland is considered a pre-Diaspora zone, if there is one at all. The Gestalts aren't after a homecoming as such, but they're seeking a disbelief in magic against all evidence to the contrary, or a return from the sundering/the fall. (<a href='/html/Role Playing Games.html'/>How is this similar or dissimilar from the Malkavians in Vampire the Masquerade?</a> How are Malkavians similar to John Malcovich (<a href='/html/Movies.html'/>Being John Malkovich</a>)?) <br/>- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Know Nothings/Free thinkers</span> - Everyone else that isn't affiliated with one group or another. There are few if any know nothings or free thinkers in all of known space and those that are tend to be engineers.<br/>Each of the religions ends up being a breeding ground for MGMT agents and counter agents (how is this like <a href='/html/Books.html'/>Prometheus Rising</a>)? Or like <a href='/html/Role Playing Games.html'/>Paranoia</a>. <br/>One peculiarity is that in space no one is an ardent rationalist/atheist. They either join one of the above listed cults (including a minor one), they become a gestaltist, they are involved in a Syndicate. The only alternatives are to become a pilot or a failed pilot, to somehow become dependent on a gestaltist or an ecologist. Life in space is such that there is no one that could be considered free psychospiritually or due to the need to pay for air/water/power. </div>
