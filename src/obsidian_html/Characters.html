In other words, she discovers that she's an android because she undergoes a condition in which she discovers that "the map is not the territory". (Should it be a sort of schizotypal awakening?) What does she then do in the story? A rogue AI is chasing her after she wakes up and wants to convert her to a cause so she stows away on a ship, slow burn to the outer planets because it has the least electrical equipment possible. How is this character like the <a href='/html/Movies.html'/>character in the fourth Alien movie</a>? Emi has a hyper real affect when it comes to the news - she believes without reservation she believes when it comes to the news without reservation on either side of every conflict, leading to unreliable narrator.  ^583967<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Josiah Erliazi</span> - An engineer who is aboard a spaceship as a technician and manages to repair one of the ships. What is special about this character? He ends up becoming a pilot because he was raised to have a completely paralyzing fear of death, which he believes to be his own hyperreal reservation. However this paralyzing fear is just an exacerbated effect of living in deep space and is completely normal for human beings.   ^18d11f<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Sobritique Entoral</span> - A gestalt theorist working with a deck of cards that is completely broke and needs to get off system due to gambling debts. She plays a game called Tompoko with his own set of cards that he's made (which also happen to be marked).  ^672a13<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Donal Entori</span> - An ecologist, has developed a new strain of drug  that causes metaphorical allusions (as opposed to merely illusion). In other words, under the influence of the drug all of reality is shifted to a metaphorical allusion to the same given constraints. A spaceship becomes a sailing ship, a space colony can become a fantasy island. Moreover, for reasons that are not apparent, the fantasy reality among users of the drug is shared in that it allows the users to enter the same fantasy reality for unknown reasons. No one knows how he managed to make the drug or why, but an artificial intelligence is after him to procure the chemical for it's own purposes. The drug is caused by a kind of mushroom that has eyes and is called <a href='/html/Technologies.html'/>entrephauna</a>. How is this like the short story by Borges about the map becoming the territory or as in Simulcra and Simulation? Or like in the Matrix?<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Twins (based on Castor and Pollux - Gemini) Esic and Oric</span> - These two should be narrators and outlaw bandits/pirates that are on the ship after being arrested by the security of the Anastasia Zirkov for some reason or another. Considered Jumpers. Two brothers.<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Entri Noro (MGMT Villain)</span> - This is a straight villainous character in the sense that I want and need a villainous character that's just evil. She lost her eyes due to an explosive decompression event during a pirate raid when she was young and worked her way up MGMT working security. She's the current bursar for the Anastasia Zirkov and her motivations are the complete protection of the ship regardless of human life.<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Janie Loretai</span> - Someone that owns a sail-ship attached to a small asteroid of reaction matter. He runs the entire operation himself along with an entirely robotized operation and is considered functionally insane/special/talented/something for doing so because he's out in space by himself. So he's liable for space madness or he couldn't pass into a port. How is this character going to help the main characters? I want him to be old and cantankerous rather than a Han Solo love interest. In Star Wars Han Solo ends up making a living by smuggling and having a faster ship. What's Janie's back story? Is he a retired miner of some sort? Or is he a religious guy? Let's say that he's the only person in the story that could be considered good so he's an anti-Han Solo in some way. An anti-anti-hero? A nihilistic do gooder? The point of the story could be that there <span style='font-style: italic;'>is</span> nothing special about him. He's just a retired guy. He's not suicidal. He doesn't have any enigmatic powers in calculating trajectories, nor is his ship faster than anyone else's. He's a bit ugly.  ^dff0d4<br/>	- So this scene comes to me (which is a bit of a takeoff on Star Wars) where he passes his ship through an impending confrontation and banks his ship off the gravity well of an armada anomaly. There are main characters on board that think he's crazy and one of them attempts to mutiny, but they all make it. And the anomaly <a href='/html/Characters.html'/>Third Armada</a> crew all ignore them after he clears the trajectory. The ship is then slingshotted out of the gravity shipping lanes and then back in, thus saving time (again a reference to Star Wars). There should be a scene where the crew are under mutiny or while the ship is in empty space. I'll have to map out the trajectory. There's a scene in this where he's high on some drug and sitting on the hull of the ship meditating while the ship is off into orbit and one of the other crew members comes up to see him. It's a bit like the "drunk" scene in films where a big truth is revealed but he's high on something else maybe? Or it turns out that he's sober and the guy that has to come out to him is high. Old man on the mountain giving advice scene.<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Gilbraith</span> -  How do we describe Gilbraith. This guy is a MGMT stooge and high up the food chain meaning that he's the last person on the planet to know what's going on. Let's say that physically he's approaching Earth normal in terms of height and weight so we know that he's wealthy. Greying hair and glasses as an affectation (again showing that he doesn't use laser correction). Everything about him would be normal on Earth, but in a gravity well speaks of wealth. Does he have a personality?  He can't just be a synecdoche. This guy is a good person insofar as he has no flaws because he's been isolated from suffering. In this way he's a kind of anti-pilot. ^4b84fc</div>
