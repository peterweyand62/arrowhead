This coming from <a href='/html/Characters.html'/>Gil</a> was a problem. <br/>		This is the situation so far as we understand it. As of <a href='/html/Questions.html'/>some time</a> we've notice two occurrences that have never happened before as far as we are aware. <br/>		There was a murmur around the <a href='/html/Story Set Pieces.html'/>table</a>. <br/>	<span style='font-weight: bold;'>The Classroom</span> - <br/>		The teacher stooped and growled past the projection and then put forward this proposed narrative. What is the problem with this <a href='/html/Past Writing Fragments.html'/>fragment</a>? <br/>		A timid hand was raised from the back to which the teacher grunted an affirmation and said "And?"<br/>		- In order to induce one gravitational unit, or one G, full Earth gravity and prevent any inner ear nausea, a torroid would have to be spinning at no more than 2 revolutions per second. The torroid would then have to be approximately a mile in diameter in order for human habitation to occur. So it would be, um, unstable. <br/>		- Close enough. Yes, it would be too large to induce one G without the centripetal force from becoming unstable gyroscopically, the error rate of which is a function of distance. In space the limiting factor has always been the human. How long can human beings exist in zero gravity. How long can human beings exist in the vacuum of space (not long). Where to place reaction mass on in well gravitational drives in order to prevent solar flares and cosmic radiation from creating cancers and DNA damage. What group dynamics, which you can talk to the card players down the hall (a titter of nervous laughter from the tiered seats of the lecture hall) all about. <br/>	<span style='font-weight: bold;'>Hull Repair Scene</span> <br/>		- There has to be a scene in which there's a hull repair during a high G maneuver or when the ship is doing something weird - or when one of the characters is inebriated. Should this be an action sce.<br/>	<span style='font-weight: bold;'>Planet description scene</span><br/>		 - There has to be a transition scene in which one of the planets is described in detail. One of the planets is being mined for ore or resources by a giant scoop ship which then transfers the ore to one of the five 2.0G interplanetary barges. Humans have to be at the helm the entire time because why? So that AI doesn't take over? Because AI or robots can't be trusted?<br/>	<span style='font-weight: bold;'>Android creation scene</span> <br/>		- there's a scene where Androids are being created by having a group of androids ship in new clones. The ship is piloted by a crew of dead or dying androids that are taking their final trip into an AI network of satellites. <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Pluto</span> had been destroyed by an anomaly and is currently being mined for wealth - since it's so dangerous and so far out of the system there are AI satellites at Pluto overseeing the operation. That AIs are being indoctrinated at Pluto by sending them through an AI field is an open secret and overlooked by everyone so long as it's "over there".<br/>	<span style='font-weight: bold;'>Sex Scene</span> <br/>		- There has to be a sex scene in here somewhere. I don't know what that would look like or what characters would be involved, but it's necessary. Multiple sex scenes? Multiple partners? Farcical/Silly or should it be more serious? Both?<br/>	<span style='font-weight: bold;'>Space Battles and/or Space Combat</span> - <br/>		- There are a variety of types of space battles that could occur, depending on the types and classes of the ships involved.<br/>			- A space battle in the shipping lanes between two trading ships and their accompanying protector armadas. The two ships have to judge gravitational topography in tacking. In the space battle ships are boarded, there's a couple of ships that are sent out of the gravity well and disappear (is this like sumo sort of?), and there are several ships that collide. So in this scenario we'll have one class of raider ships and two syndicates from rival trading groups that band together in order to fend off the raiders.<br/>			- A space battle between two groups of anomaly drive ships each side with one or more capital ships. The <a href='/html/Characters.html'/>Third Armada</a> is called in to the battle, but the armada doesn't do anything and just sits by the sidelines as it makes sure that either a gravity well (planet), or shipping lane is threatened. <br/>			- A space battle between <br/>		<br/>	<a href='/html/Table of Contents.html'/>Scene 1</a> - <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Public scene between <a href='/html/Characters.html'/>Emi</a> and <a href='/html/Characters.html'/>Josiah</a></span> <br/>		- From one perspective this is reminiscent of a scene from <a href='/html/Books.html'/>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a>. One of the characters believes that he is being given commands from the AI quantum computer, while the other character believes they are being given commands from the computer but both can't be right. <br/>	    Scene - There's a decompression event leading to both of them stuck in a spaceship and the question is which one the ship will allow to drive. Which ends up being Josiah, because he's a human being and not a robot, and not Emi because she is. <span style='font-style: italic;'>Lame idea.</span> There have to be ways in which robots and human beings differ more than whether or not they can drive or not. <br/>	    They differ in the sense that Emi can't deal with the hyperreal with respect to news items. She believes that anything no matter how improbable when respect to the news is real. So when she reacts to a news item that's on a billboard in a paranoid way he sees a fellow traveler because he believes that since he himself is an android she too must be an android. In which case he's right for the wrong reasons and thus approaches her attempting an escape from a decompression event in a space station that wasn't going to happen from the information they had. But would have happened due to a Gestalt theorist who put them in the same <a href='/html/Books.html'/>"orbit"</a>. The AI was attempting to get Emi to do something wrong to begin with according to a hyperreal defect (which is why androids are paranoid about having "sex") and so a Gestalt theorist had organized for the two of them to be in close proximity in the space station to begin with. That theorist is <a href='/html/Characters.html'/>Sobritique</a>. What is her motivation other than being broke? It's a kind of Shanghai in order to organize a stowaway onboard a deep space ship that is holding a rogue scientist. The scientist/ecologist has genetic material for a kind of <a href='/html/Technologies.html'/>drug</a> that will grow on Mars or deep space, which we don't know at this point if he grew himself or stole. He's the run from the MGMT authorities.<br/>	    </div>
