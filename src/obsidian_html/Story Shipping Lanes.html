<div style='background: lightgreen; margin: -10px; padding: 20px; max-width: caclc(100% - 10px);<br/>        min-height:1000px;'>According to OpenAI here are the approximate travel times between the planets if you start with a speed of 1 gravity, end with a speed of 1 day and between the planets travel at 2.0 gravities. This should be considered approximate.<br/><br/>1. Mercury to Venus: 2.60 days<br/>2. Venus to Earth: 3.38 days<br/>3. Earth to Mars: 5.37 days<br/>4. Mars to Jupiter: 9.12 days<br/>5. Jupiter to Saturn: 14.43 days<br/>6. Saturn to Uranus: 23.69 days<br/>7. Uranus to Neptune: 35.44 days<br/>8. Uranus to Pluto: 39.37 days<br/><br/>1. Mercury to Venus: 2.60 days<br/>2. Venus to Earth: 3.38 days<br/>3. Earth to Mars: 5.37 days<br/>4. Mars to Asteroid Belt: 8.18 days<br/>5. Asteroid Belt to Jupiter: 12.44 days<br/>6. Jupiter to Saturn: 14.43 days<br/>7.

Uranus to Pluto: 39.37 days<br/><br/>If there are five sky barges of 2.0 ships then there can be 5 shipping lanes that will interweave between the planets.  Barges 1 and 2 cross paths, barges 3 and 4 cross paths, and barges 4 and 5 cross paths so that it's possible to travel the length of the solar system without reaching planet fall. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Barge 1</span> - <br/>	Mercury, Venus, Earth<br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Barge 2</span> - <br/>	Moon, Mars, Asteroid Belt (does not cross path of barge 3)<br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Barge 3</span> - <br/>	(does not cross path of barge 2) Asteroid Belt, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus<br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Barge 4</span> - Uranus, Neptune <br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Barge 5</span> - Neptune, Pluto. <br/><br/>The barges follow the path of the ecliptic and only travel between adjacent planets as compared to their distance from the sun. So they wouldn't travel from Venus directly to Mars. They also travel in the same direction as the rest of the planets (counterclockwise when viewed from the sun's North Pole). While travel times might be faster otherwise they don't do this because they're resulting masses would destabilize the orbits of the planets. A clockwise fall of the sky barges would cause the orbital rotations of the planets to reverse. They also don't orbit the sun outside the plane of the ecliptic. This is done because it's considered psychologically risky and may drive people insane to be so far away from a planetary body - commonly held superstition following the Gestalt Diaspora and the Battle of Saturnalia 234. The three remaining city ships do orbit outside of the plane of the ecliptic and appear and disappear from view of planets in the rest of the solar system. Most people don't know what their orbits are.</div>
