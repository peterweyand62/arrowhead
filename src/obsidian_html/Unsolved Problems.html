<div style = 'background: lightgreen; margin: -10px; padding: 20px; max-width: calc(100% - 10px);<br/>    min-height:1000px;'>Here are a list of unsolved problems that may be unsolvable. What qualifies as a "problem" are those examples of sets of facts that lead to a philosophical contradiction to society's way of life, when taking society as broadly defined as possible in order to consider this "society's way of life" to be broadly defined humanistic values.<br/><br/>Compound Interest  ^ec0148<br/>Compound interest can be given by the formula <br/>`FV=PV<span style='font-style: italic;'>(1+r)^(n</span>t)` <br/>which is to say that Future Value is dependent on Present Value times one plus the interest rate raised to the compounding rate multiplied by the compounding time. The problem is that compound interest is exponentially increasing in a world of finite resources. Either technology exponentially increases or within a generation mass inflation destroys the worldwide economic system. At 3 percent increase in real GDP per year a nominal value of $100 would have to be $724 in order to retain it's value in real terms in 100 years. As far as I understand, technology doesn't scale exponentially. What is the solution? Future utopian idealism not dependent on GDP, mass unrest, AI techno utopianism, art utopianism? This is not an easy problem to solve.<br/><br/>Faster than Light Travel vs. Colonization<br/>This is somewhat related to the compound interest problem as stated above - to the extent that the question is how are human beings consumers of the resources around them given that these resources are finite. If alpha centauri is 4 light years away, do human beings end up colonizing the planets, such as Mars, using Terraforming? And when they've finished colonizing the planets then what? Only a certain amount of matter can be transferred down the gravity well without affecting the gravity of a planet, and so there's a limit to even transferring inputs to production.</div>
