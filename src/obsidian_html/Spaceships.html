<div style='background: lightgreen; margin: -10px; padding: 20px; max-width: caclc(100% - 10px);<br/>        min-height:1000px;'>Here are notes on spaceship and spaceship design, <br/><br/>Fictional Spaceships<br/>These spaceships will be used in the creation of my story. ^b6663f<br/><br/>There are a variety of spaceship designs that form a system of space travel in our story depending on how far out into deep space the characters travel. Broadly defined the ships are composed of classes of ships depending on how close to a gravity well they are. <br/><h1><br/> Classes of Spaceship<br/></h1><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Reaction mass ships</span> -<br/>	These are ships that are contain their own reaction mass and use ion propulsion drives powered by fission reactors and direct chemical combustion. There are several classes of these ships as<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Raiders</span> - High G burn vessels that are raiders that attempt to raid the capital ships that use reaction mass drives because they are quite a bit smaller. Any crew class of 100 people or fewer. Because raiding vessels are quite a bit smaller and don't have the reaction mass to travel between planets, most raids occur either between two capital ships that meet in space (space battle!) or where raiding ships are in orbit around a moon or nearby gravity well. Raiding sometimes happens between ships following the <span style='font-weight: bold;'>sky barges</span>.<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Miners</span> - Ships that are studded with ion propulsion drives and have almost no reaction mass they are used to prospect in the Kepler belt. Some have been converted into pirate raiders or are home to extended pirate families. Mine for reaction mass fuel from asteroids.<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Gravity Well ships</span> - Not often used any more as most propulsion off planet is by magnetic rail ports, some spaceships carting dignitaries or small crews of 100 people or fewer still take off from planet using chemical rockets.<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Gravity Sail Ships</span> - Spaceships that follow in the wake of one of the five large <span style='font-weight: bold;'>sky barges</span> that travel between the planets trading goods. Hundreds of spaceships travel along the space routes and have almost no reaction mass for chemical rockets, but trade for fission fuel for ion drives. They use solar sails to take in and out of the gravity well wake and use sensitive gravitational detectors to do so. Raiding between sail ships is common as it's too expensive to provide MGMT security between all the ships. Security is reserved for collections of armada ships owned by families and MGMT is reserved for space stations and ships. This is not to say that the space ships are close to each other - on the contrary the ships are 10s of thousands of miles apart. The largest of these ships are little more than living quarters wrapped around tradable mass and reaction thrusters. They are accompanied by a complement of armed warships keeping a defense perimeter to prevent raiding. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Capital ships for travel between planets in space</span> -<br/>	Capital ships that rely on entrapped black holes for gravitation (how is this like <a href='/html/Books.html'/>Ender's Game</a> insofar as black holes near gravity wells can be used to implode a planet? While possible it would be so insanely expensive that no one attempts this because the creation of capital ships requires imploding mile wide asteroids - and so capital ships are named after the asteroids that they implode into a black hole in order to power the ship. The ships gravity depends on the size of the micro black hole and can range anywhere from 0.1G to 2.0G with the crew being able to live on the ship for only so long as their health will allow consider the gravity constraints.) How long would it take for one ship to navigate from one gravity well to another? There are five 2.0G ships (the <span style='font-weight: bold;'>sky barges</span>) in existence that are on slingshot orbits between the planets in the system. There is no crew compliment, but only rad hardened non-AI computational systems. If any of these five ships stops moving in their orbits it could destabilize the alignment of the planets. One of the planets already blew up and fractured due to a miscalculation - Pluto. The pieces of which are now used for capital ship creation. <a href='/html/Story Shipping Lanes.html'/>Here</a> is a shipping lane schedule of times depending on gravity fall.<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Sky Barges</span> - The five large 2.0G ships are called sky barges and their orbits have been carefully calculated to prevent the collapse of the solar system's orbits and prevent planets from colliding into one another. Each of the barges is a mile long spaceship (large) entirely composed of the machinery needed to keep the black hole stabilized. Hundreds of spaceships (<span style='font-weight: bold;'>sail ships</span>) follow the sky barges along the orbits between the planets trading goods. <br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Anomaly Ships</span> - Ships that are have their own black hole and don't use the shipping lanes (is that what I should call it? What about gravity lanes or something? But then I'm using the word gravity too much). They can't be used for shipping because they're too slow compared to the shipping lanes. They're used by large corporations to travel between the shipping lanes either for exploration or for military purposes between planets or against raiders. With few exceptions, such as ships that are expressly owned and operated by governments for the military the ships are owned by the consortium that pays for the anomaly. All of the most recent ships are of anomalies of 0.1G to 0.5G at the largest. There are somewhere on the order of 3000 or so of these ships, with a logarithmic curve describing the number of ships as compared to the size of their mass driver. Here the mass driver is the name we are giving to the anomaly. There are approximately 2000 ships with mass drivers between 0.1G and 0.15G and between 0.45G and 0.5G mass drivers there are less than 50.<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'><a href='/html/Political Groups.html'/>The Third Armada</a></span> - A special case of the anomaly ships, this police force is used to create [n-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem) orbits between various factions if a potential conflict between anomaly ships would cause a gravitational distortion that would disrupt a gravity well or the space lanes. N-body problems are considered computationally chaotic, so even numerical methods are no guarantee that a choreographic solution (no collisions, no ejections) exists.<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>City Ships</span> - There are only a few of the 1.0G city ships still in existence - that is anomaly ships that have a gravity well that is close to Earth Standard that don't follow the gravity wells. These ships are domed cities. How many of them are there? There are two cities that collided and collapsed into a trench on Mars which then were used to start terraforming the planet (what's the name of the largest trench on Mars?). The city states are largely autonomous because they need to be able to exist for long periods without trade. Many of the <a href='/html/Characters.html'/>best ecologists</a> come from the city ships as they maintain a functioning biosphere. Each of the city ships should have it's own craftsmanship that's particular to the city, mostly because when they were created there wasn't a standard way to create a city. Partly because the one's that didn't have their own unique structure ended up imploding. The city's architecture and machinery gives rise to a certain culture. Further the city ships don't rotate the sun on the path of the ecliptic and when outside of the ecliptic can perform maneuvers that aren't predictably visible from planets.<br/>			- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Asteroid #234 and Saturnalia</span> - Two city ships that fought the Great City State war above the planet Mars. The war was fought over which city could orbit in a Lagrange point intersecting the space lanes of the incoming <span style='font-weight: bold;'>sky barges</span>. The ultimately collided and degraded down into Martian orbit over the course of two and half years (the fateful 900 days). As a last ditch maneuver the governments of the two city states steered the jury rigged structure into a side canyon of the Valles Marineris trench, which is where the original Martian colonists come from. The members of the crew are celebrated as heroes or villains in a local humanist pantheon, <a href='/html/Characters.html'/>The Order of the Fallen</a>. <br/>			- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Greater Plutonian Hive Cluster IV</span> - A hollowed out asteroid the GPHCIV is an approximately 5 mile on a side block containing 200,000 people and is the smallest city ship. <br/>			- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Cleveland, OH</span> - The only city that was managed to be uplifted (the necessary mass to do so was replaced to maintain Earth gravity (although it was minor)). The cluster resembles the city in its' entirety save for the large self healing domes that protect the city from space radiation and can polarize to create night and day conditions. Pilgrimage area for the Disorder (Order of the Gestalts). Cleveland, OH is one of if not the only place in which there has been no diaspora at all, or the diaspora is itself not recognized. Of the 500,000 people that are living in Cleveland, OH all of them both recognize and don't recognize that the Gestalt-Diaspora has occurred. How is this similar to the movie <a href='/html/Movies.html'/>Dark City</a>? Is this a cliche?<br/>			- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>NeoGaia</span> - A giant living structure, the newest of the city states (having 1,000,000 people), composed almost entirely of biological material as a living rainforest, save for the necessary machinery to maintain the anomaly. The ship was created after the implosion of Pluto in the event that the Earth imploded due to an anomaly event. NeoGaia contains almost every endangered specie on Earth and many that have been bio-reengineered and cloned. Pilgrimage area for the Order of the Beast.   ^465b6e<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Capital Ship factories</span> - <br/>	There are only three capital ship factories in existence. One owned by Mars, one owned by the Moon, and one owned by Earth. These are so massive and so expensive to operate that each of these factories is considered it's own independent nation-state with geopolitics important to the politics of the entire system as a whole. Question - wouldn't these factories have to be owned near large asteroid belts? Or where they can capture asteroids? Mass comes in from the five 2.0G ships which is stabilized and then imploded into a micro-anomaly.  ^329fea<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Space Stations</span> -<br/>	Space stations don't have gravity (spinning torroidal rings don't work). But are refueling zones for reaction mass in orbit, radar relays, and research stations. Mass for trade that can't be used for reaction tends to stay in geosynch orbit or at Lagrange points if it's not sent planet side. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Gates</span> - <br/>	These are areas in interstellar space that are as far from a gravity well as possible where time and space are completely flat. When someone approaches a gate they're shot from a capital ship in a pod that contains only so much onboard life support systems as are necessary for the crew compliment and nothing else. The only reason that people know that the gates themselves exist is because people have come out the other side first and appear to be able to predict the future or have magic powers. This appears to defy rational explanation other than these Outsiders as they are called are able to detect patterns within group human interactions. The only ones that can understand them are the Artificial intelligence networks relying on Bose Einstein Condensates and qubits. This then is the set up for the story. (What's going to happen here is that anyone who goes through a Gate has no phenomenal input to reality whatsoever - so there are people go through the gate that have complete Ego Loss and impairment and those who have their psyches' merged - that's what happens with the three magi as they come to be known that come in through the first gate located 100,000 miles out beyond Pluto.) Since other galaxies (the closest being Alpha Centauri at 4 light years) are so far away that there's no way to reach them by even gravity ships this is the only way of traveling so far as is known. But then how can resources be pushed through the gates as opposed to just a handful of people? This becomes a major plot point in the novel.<br/>	<h1><br/> Spaceship Composition For Specific Ships<br/></h1><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Spaceship Definition</span> - Spaceships can be defined by the combination of their properties. When taken together they mostly define the type of the ship as their are a finite number of combinations of elements that make up a ship. Ships are classified by crew complement, dimensions, propulsion, designation, and ownership.<br/>		- <span style='font-weight: bold;'><span style='font-weight: bold;'>*Crew Complements</span>*</span><br/>		- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>*Bridge Crew Complements (Above Decks)*</span><br/>			All crews by necessity have an engineer as pilot, an ecologist as druggist for the crew, an artificial intelligence to provide the necessary calculations. They also have MGMT overseers that are mostly in the way but safeguard the ship and are antagonists when the ship is away from port. That's what's considered the bridge, which is always formed in this manner with few if any exceptions. This is considered the <span style='font-weight: bold;'>*traditional*</span> method of composing a bridge crew and is mandatory for any <span style='font-weight: bold;'>anomaly ships</span> that have their own gravity well. Smaller vessels up to most sail ships will copy this method to some extent sometimes only for appearances sake.<br/>		- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>*Support Crew (Below Decks)*</span><br/>			Below decks crew are differentiated by their designation. The main designations are life support, engineering, trade, and sociology. These designations are much more fluid as compared to the bridge crew complement, and differ between classes of ship. Typically there is some reason for the ship to exist, whether that be as an exploration type ship, for communications, or as a ship carrying cargo. Someone who cares about the operation of the spaceship and is financing its operations will have a crew overseeing that aspect of onboard life, whether that be MGMT, the Engineers and so forth. This would be considered the trade aspect of ship life. Life support is self explanatory, but is such an important part of the ship that it almost always has its own below decks crew. Engineering is concerned with the running of the ship and the propulsion system. Sociology handles all other aspects of the ship that are concerned with making it so that the people onboard the ship are able to function in outer space. There are other below decks departments that are occasionally found in ships, these being weapons complements or communications arrays. Some of the largest below decks crews include people that handle sail knitting and manufacture for solar sails when those sails can be kilometers long. (<a href='/html/Books.html'/>How is this like the Jack Vance story Sail 25?</a>). If there are passengers or a passenger manifest in the ship then there may be a support crew for passengers themselves. Most ships have some number of paying passengers aboard, but only as a small fraction of the above and below decks crew.<br/>		- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Dimensions of the Spaceship</span><br/>			- These are the ship dimensions by class. Larger reaction mass ships can be several 100 yards long in order to contain all of their chemical components. Some sail ships are only small living quarters strapped to small asteroids studded with ion jets. The infamous sky barges are miles long hunks of metal and iron that are perpetually falling into their own gravity well. Typically the size of ships depends on the amount of chemical mass they must contain, or the size of the ship needed to contain it's anomaly. <br/>		- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Propulsion Type / Class</span><br/>			- As discussed above the mass driver (if an using an anomaly) of the ship, or else the reaction driver or sail ship type. The main types of propulsion are ion drives, chemical drives, solar sails, and anomaly drives. A ship is classified by the size of it's reaction mass and the power output of fission drives in use for ion engines, or the size of it's anomaly. <br/>		- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Designation</span> <br/>			- The designation of the ship depends on the ships purpose. There are only a few such purposes for any spaceship owing to cost<br/>				- Raiding other ships<br/>				- Trade using the shipping lanes<br/>				- Exploration or MGMT owned large anomaly warships<br/>				- Communications ships or support ships for trade<br/>				- City ships<br/>				- Pilgrimage or Religious Ships (<a href='/html/Books.html'/>How is this like Hyperion</a>?)<br/>		- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Ownership</span> <br/>			- The ownership of the spaceship can be of only of a few different types. It can be MGMT owned by a consortium of syndicates. It can be owned by a large family syndicate, which mostly occurs due to sail ship barges in the shipping lanes or pirate syndicates in the asteroid belt. It can be owned by a large gravity well (such as Mars or Earth) in which case the ship is either running security or is facilitating trade. Or it can be run by one of the religious groups in use for a pilgrimage. <br/><h1><br/> Named Spaceships / Specific Spaceships<br/></h1><br/>All spaceships, outside of shuttlecraft have a name, the same as boats do in navies. They are incredibly expensive and are often named after their Syndicate consortium, a religious or famous figure. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Anastasia Zirkov</span> - <span style='font-weight: bold;'>*Reaction Mass Sail Ship Class*</span> - A radar array ship following a <span style='font-weight: bold;'>sky barge</span> and used to detect raiders, detect gravitational waves of the wake, and provide point to point communication between ships by cleaning the signal of any AI communications that could contain sub-signals that are dangerous or illicit causing psychogenetic illness. The AZ is considered to be a neutral ship as it retransmits signals and radar waves. It's paid for by a collection of armada consortiums that are currently on friendly terms. <br/>	- crew complement<br/>	- dimensions<br/>	- propulsion <br/>	- designation <br/>	- ownership ^015f59</div>
