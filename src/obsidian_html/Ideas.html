<div style='background: lightgreen; margin: -10px; padding: 20px; max-width: caclc(100% - 10px);<br/>        min-height:1000px;'>Here is the section on ideas - <br/><br/>- In the <a href='/html/Houses.html'/>Psychedelic House</a> numerology becomes important. For example, 34 means to be free from as in this quote from <a href='/html/Books.html'/>Prometheus Rising</a> (hence showing that someone is free from the "bio-survival circuit") - “The “wiring” of this circuit, in primitive form, occurred in the first organisms, between three and four billion years ago. ” This use of psychedelic numerology is such that if someone mentions it they are considered "sick" and the psychedelia crowd will drug them.<br/>	- Further Notes - In the  <a href='/html/Houses.html'/>Psychedelic House</a> there is also the book <a href='/html/Books.html'/>There is No Antimemetics Division</a>, which mentions giraffes, which is a responses to giraffes attempting to mate with Jeeps as mention in <a href='/html/Books.html'/>Prometheus Rising</a>. When someone is unliked what you can do is you can drug them and then have cars pull away from the curb when they walk by matching their speed. Or you can drug them and have cars pass revving their engines. This is a way of hurting someone, and then later asking for forgiveness by demanding it because they've been so traumatized or brain damaged.<br/>	- Consider this paragraph in its' totality - “The “wiring” of this circuit, in primitive form, occurred in the first organisms, between three and four billion years ago. In the modern human, this structure remains in the brain stem and in the autonomic (“involuntary”) nervous system, where it is interconnected with the endocrine and other life-support systems. This is why disturbances on this circuit act “all over the body at once” and generally take the form of physical symptoms rather than “mental” symptoms and usually get referred to the M.D. instead of the psychiatrist.” - By suggesting that 34 is then a cutting off of the idea, the suggestion is that if this is accepted that the person will be referred to a doctor as opposed to a psychiatrist. So you can drug someone and if they're willing to "let it go",  you will not drive them crazy. If they aren't, you will. You can see this numerological consideration of 34 throughout the <a href='/html/Houses.html'/>Psychedelic House</a> and is one of it's main attributes. This numerology is also present in the works of <a href='/html/Books.html'/>Robert Machen</a> and may come ultimately from fin-de-cecil literature. <br/>	- A further threat in the literature “Some imprint bravery, inquisitiveness and the exploratory drive; others imprint timidity, infophobia (fear of the unpredictable) and withdrawal, of which the extreme case is the sad imprint called autism or childhood schizophrenia.” - You can then drive someone into an autistic state using this book and it's methods via manipulation, drug abuse, and thought control.<br/>	- A further note on the text - note the use of grammar that is similar to Sartre and can thus be taken to some extent as an extension and critique of Sartre. From the use of linguistic analysis we can see where the ideas that he's getting come from. For example, the use of "concretely" to show that an example of an abstract idea in a real world context, or "anguish". Robert Anton Wilson is here critiquing Being and Nothingness. Since information is transmitted, by linguistic analysis we can then show how information over time is modified according to a graph based analysis (as in graph theory), so long as information isn't pure maths. If philosophy is the study of truth, and truth is in some sense that which informs a priori that which came after (the idea behind the idea of any author), then by using this approach we can find which ideas in culture are those that inform the culture as a whole. To give a "concrete" example - if there is a science fiction book that is widely read whose main ideas are more properly understood in the context of a philosophical text, then in order to understand the ideas in the science fiction story and all its implications as rigorously as opposed to popularly defined, you should read the philosophical text. And the transmission of that text from philosopher to science fiction author may be through some other cultural medium or in combination with other philosophical texts.<br/>- One idea is that there could be some subconscious that is dependent on an interrelated connection of phenomenal links across nodes. These phenomenal links are such that they are connected via probability such that there is no necessary input nor output, but each node is connected via a probability. There is some pointer or collection of pointers that traverse the connected graph by the probabilities assigned to a node. So if a pointer is at node 1 and there is a probability to node 2 that is 37 percent then in the next time period if the pointer moves from point 1 to point 2 the probability is raised from 37 to 38, and if the probability is lowered it moves from 37 to 36. Given this, if a node is activated from outside of the matrix, either via the act of memory (or remembering) or via phenomenal input to consciousness (perception or hearing) then this would add a pointer that would traverse the graph via a certain number of steps and return the output or the nodes reached and their correlation. This would provide a <a href='/html/Books.html'/>Sartreian</a>"this" which would have it's own quality which would change over time. This matrix would have to have the property that it would never reach a corner solution so that all of the probabilities were static. It would need the further property that the resulting "quality" epi-phenomenon could pass a fitness requirement so that they either were rejected or were accepted to avoid hallucinations and to accept the increased correlations that the traversed pointer(s) provided. This fitness criteria would be along the lines of some genetic or evolutionary algorithm, because if the terms of the maximization are human defined, then the matrix will be over or under defined and reach corner solutions or no useful data; in other words it must have the real as the base of cognition (and so must have perception - what does this mean? Is it enough to be able to traverse the internet for data?). Note that this is different than backwards propagation using gradient descent and calculus in that there is no maximal solution. Each of the resulting "this"'s of quality would then make it so that they would become new nodes in some other matrix of correlated correlations at a higher level that is away from base perception.<br/>- These moving correlation pointers would (at a conscious level) be similar to a <a href='/html/Books.html'/>Sartreian</a> cogito. What would this be considered at a subconscious level - perhaps a <a href='/html/Books.html'/>Wilsonian</a> system of Maslovian (Malsow's hierarchy of needs) drives? And how does this relate to Sartre's circuit of selves.<br/>	- A subnote to Wilson. This idea of their being differentiable drives does not mean religion as such (excepting perhaps the ability of their being a meta-programming or near death experience of a self object) as relates to a computer. What is important is that there may be levels of conscious self that are in a sense competitive or at the least complementary. These matrices of interrelated nodes may be such that they come from a base level of phenomenon across time and are at different layers. The drives (or circuits of self) themselves would have to be interlayer collections of nodes that were interconnected via high probability of transmission (bio-survival, logistical, sexual, etc) from one node or collection of nodes to the next. To the extent that <span style='font-weight: bold;'>*these*</span> collections were activated and to what extent would inform a sense of self across time.<br/>	- This would then have to be differentiable from what constituted the self. Would the self then become an emerging property of this collection of matrices? Or would the self instead have to be defined in such a way so that there were an a priori matrix (or interrelated collection of nodes) that constituted a self-reflecting sense-of-self object?<br/>- Quantum computing generally speaking. There are many aspects to quantum computing but here are a couple. <br/>	- Quantum computing using [Superconducting quantum computing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_quantum_computing) Bose Einstein Condensates in a vacuum means that quantum computing might be scalable in space and on the hulls of micro satellites. Is this what Astro's laser project is aiming at?<br/>	- Are quantum computing models necessary to create the qualified "thisness" of Sartrian quality. As in the correlation of qubits is an emergent property of correlation that scales exponentially as opposed to traditional computing.<br/>	- To the extent that the <a href='/html/Unsolved Problems.html'/>compound interest</a> posits a world of infinite resources or an exponential return on capital, quantum computing solves this problem from the compute side (as LLM models and crypto-currency do not) because every added qubit expands computational power exponentially, as a power of the prior number of qubits that are entangled. To what extent exponentially increasing computational power relates to exponentially increased returns on capital as applied to physical goods is unknown. <br/>- One idea that comes from <a href='/html/Books.html'/>The Silmarillion</a> is that if I can create the cosmology or the world building enough then I can put the characters in it in such a way that they'll fit into the scene. It's the house building, the story after method of creating a story. If I can fit in Simulcra and Simulation and Sarte that should work. </div>
