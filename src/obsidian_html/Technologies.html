<div style = 'background: lightgreen; margin: -10px; padding: 20px; max-width: calc(100% - 10px);<br/>    min-height:1000px;'><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Plastisteel</span> - A catch all term for an item that has the flexibility and mailability of plastic with the strength of steel. ^2236c5<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Silicate Crystallography</span> - This is a type of hardware that relies on lower power three dimensional transistors within a silicate matrix. There are limiting constraints in processing power and so cybernetic models that rely on silicate crystallography have a log linear learning curve. That is, they are only able to process a finite amount of information and so become specialized in a subtask without engendering hyper real hallucinations in which they confuse fiction for reality, the sign and the symbol in much the same way as <a href='/html/Books.html'/>Baudrillard talks about hyper reality</a>. Still silicate crystallography has an exponential plateau curve that is much higher than traditional circuitry, and so it has enough processing power to mimic the human brain in most cases. ^958f51<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Qubit Quantum Computer AI</span> - An AI that uses qubits to develop higher order thinking. Using Bose Einstein Condensates most computer AIs exist between collections of satellites.<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Weaponry</span> - There are five kinds of weaponry that are typically used in space. <br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Officially licensed ship board weaponry</span> - Officially licensed ship board weaponry is available based on number of credits. These weapons are either knives or flechette guns or stun guns that won't pierce hulls.<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Illegal weapons</span> - Any weapon that will pierce a hull. Being caught with such a weapon is liable to have someone thrown out an airlock by a mob. It is considered incredibly stupid to be caught with an illegal weapon.<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Boarding weapons</span> - Any weapons that are designed to board a spaceship. Typically there are jury rigged or engineered blasting caps to pierce spaceship hulls. Most ship board combat and boarding is done by marauders or capital ship crews that use powered armor, with electronic measures and counter measures in order to cloak the location of electronic signatures. People who are good at boarding use suits with almost no electronic signature at all and the smallest suit profile. These people are either good at their job or they're suicidal. <br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Ship to ship weapons, ground to ship weapons, ship to ground weapons</span> - Most weapons are based on gravitational attraction. Missiles tend not to work because they are seen from so far away - such as tens of thousands of miles. Most ship to ship combat is such that one ship will attempt to maneuver another ship so it's stuck outside the gravitational shipping lanes or runs out of reaction mass and is set adrift. Or is such that the ship's trajectory allows it to be boarded. Ship to ship combat is often done around valuable resources such as asteroid belts, and so one method of combat is to have one ship run out of reaction mass and collide with an asteroid or several asteroids. Energy weapons do not work over large distances (such as lasers), because it requires too much energy to pierce a hull and it's too difficult to target a ship at distance. The further away the target is the smaller the deviation of the angle of the laser has to be to accurately stay on target, which matters if the ship is attempting to evade. Point to point laser communications are still used for satellite communications around gravity wells.<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Nuclear weapons</span> - Nuclear weapons are never used except by terrorists or the suicidal. They end up destroying the target and any valuables (such as people and the ship itself) on board. In order for a nuclear weapon to be used that weapon would have to first be snuck on board and then exploded by the boarding party, so it just doesn't make sense from a tactical perspective. When a ship is set to self destruct, typically the cores of the ship will be programmed to explode. There are other considerations. Sometimes nuclear weapons are used in missiles, but when two ships are close enough for ship to ship combat, then the battle is either almost over (because it's a battle over the gravity well) or there is a boarding party involved. If the ships are too far apart then missiles between capital ships are easily seen and countermeasures are used. Similar to the situation with capital ships the defense then has the advantage, because it's easier to create chafe near a ship and missiles are seen coming for hundreds of kilometers. Capital ships that have difficulty maneuvering may have arrays of point defense canon.<br/>	- <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Note on the ABT (Anomaly Ban Treaty)</span> - It is speculated, although unknown, that a terrorist action driving a singularity into <a href='/html/Story Locations.html'/>Pluto</a> (The Great Pluto Disaster) was the cause of the destruction of the planet into a mass of asteroids. No anomaly is allowed within 10,000 miles (is this the right distance?) of a planetary body or it's considered a hostile action. There are rules on how much mass and under what amount of reaction thrust is allowed within a gravity well as mass weapons are considered more dangerous than atomics.<br/>	<span style='font-weight: bold;'>NOTE:</span> There is no such thing as energy shielding, although most ships will magnetize a hull if traveling within an asteroid field or as mining ships. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Musical Instruments</span> - One of the items of note is that in this setting the musical instruments don't come from sound, but electronics. There is no sound in space. The most common instruments in space tend to be theremins or their equivalent that rely on hand motions (guitar theremins for example), percussion instruments, and what else? Could there be musical instruments that are based on gravitonics or some other way of communicating (does this even make sense)?<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Wirejacked</span> - Electromechanical wire laced throughout a person's nervous system heightening their reflexes at the expense of potentially causing their entire cortical stack take a dump resulting in seizures, heart attack, stroke, or having their breathing stop. How is this like <a href='/html/Role Playing Games.html'/>Cyberpunk 2077</a>? <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Moon Stations</span> - The primary method of creating space station depots is to take an existing moon in orbit and converting it, for a number of practical reasons. First, it's orbit is known and the inside can slowly be excavated into living quarters. Second, inter-Syndicate treatise concerning ecological nativism following the Pluto disaster emphasizes keeping pre-existing orbits of celestial bodies wherever possible. The method of converting a moon to a space stations is to replace interior mass with living quarters and then using craters as foundation areas for domes and structures while being careful to maintain the mass of the moon, building on top of depressions with the same mass that was excavated from the interior. Craters are useful because they're protected on several sides from radiation, while still provide an area open to the space for incoming light, which is useful for greenhouses, energy collection, and communications.  ^10d233<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Goggles</span> - A heads up overlay that is similar to ski goggles, they take the place of onboard computers for most people. They're approximately as powerful as a personal computer can be without resorting to silicate crystallography or qubits, so they're more a matter of personal style as anything else. What people are after in the novel is information and most people, while computer networking is possible, aren't willing to network two computers together over (say) a wifi like network for fear of information theft. Goggles are mostly used for working or during high computational work that relies on working with a computer network and not social interaction. Everyone has an overlay of every person they meet anyway, and it's considered socially appropriate to just ignore that this is true. Most space stations and ports also share a haptic overlay 3D environment that can only be viewed through goggles. Some places use this and some don't. The <a href='/html/Story Locations.html'/>GPHCIV</a> relies almost entirely on goggles as it's part cultural. They rely the most on experimental technology as well. ^173731<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Gravtopo lens</span> - A gravitational detector that is mounted on a camera array that creates a three dimensional topographic map of gravitational waves. Reading a gravitational topographic map is one of the first things that people learn in space. Most space stations won't even let you on a space station unless you can read a topographic map. (Should there be a test for being on a space station or in space so you don't die or get someone else killed?) ^84ba9c<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Spacesuits</span> - There are as many types of spacesuit as there are ways of robotizing a suit, although most experienced spacers are unlikely to trust robotized suits for either combat or for repairs as electronics have the potential to be hacked or suffer from solar flares. The typical spacer spacesuit is such that it relies on double hulled pneumatic pressure. Spacesuits for high G-maneuvers require the users to breathe in liquid filled gel that contains oxygen which can cause distress in those that aren't experienced in "swimming". Spacesuits tend to be highly personal pieces of equipment, depending on the person. Spacesuits differ between those that are used on a planet and those that are used by in space. They also differ between those suits that are used by the wealthy and those suits that are used by those that mostly have to do dock work, or other kinds of work. Spacesuits tend to have oxygen jets (specifically not ion jets) for thrust, but that can depend on the size of the onboard oxygen. Space suits typically come in classes depending on onboard oxygen, sensor arrays, and pneumatics. Space suits don't contain weaponry per se, unless specified modified, in which case it's not a function of its' class. <br/>	<span style='font-weight: bold;'>Emi's Suit</span> - Emi's suit is specifically made for ship board duty. There are magnetic soles on her shoes, biologics to eat dead skin for long term wear, and a hood that comes up and covers her head and self inflates. Her backpack contains enough liquid for 24 hours of oxygen when she has a resting heart rate. The suit is double hulled, with an interior <a href='/html/Technologies.html'/>thermofungi</a> that eats dead skin living within. There is on onboard battery that converts the liquid oxygen into gaseous oxygen using a heating coil. Noticeably, she only has three thrusters on her suit in order to complete emergency maneuvers. One on her palm, one on her foot, and one on the back of her suit. These three thrusters are such that she can control direction, velocity, and spin at the same time which is the mandatory for any suit, but any thrust which she uses will end up depleting her onboard oxygen. Depending on how much thrust is needed in an emergency she can deplete her onboard oxygen in a matter of minutes and suffocate. She only has a small reserve of water (a liter). Because the hood is insulated and her whole suit is meant mostly for emergencies she uses her <a href='/html/Technologies.html'/>goggles</a> and suit mounted cameras to view trajectories including thermal and <a href='/html/Technologies.html'/>a gravtopo lens</a>. Her suit would be considered one of the most basic and cheapest available for ship board duty.<br/><h1><br/> Drugs and Biologics<br/></h1><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Trang</span> - A drug (which I'm taking from the drink mix of the same name - [tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_(drink_mix)) and not the drug [tranq](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/07/health/fentanyl-xylazine-drug.html). In some sense I'm reappropriating the name in order to make it silly rather than sad and remember something other than what's currently being used for <a href='/html/Story Themes.html'/>(see story theme on drug use)</a>. It smells like burnt oranges and is a kind of heady hypnotic that completely disables the inner ear, and inexperienced users feel a sense of dysphoria. Considered a banned narcotic, it's used by the <a href='/html/Religion.html'/>Void Star</a> and <a href='/html/Characters.html'/>Jumpers</a> in initiation rituals.  ^048b05<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Entrephauana</span> - A kind of psychedelic mushroom with eyes that causes the user to hallucinate in a shared delusion with other people that have taken the drug. No one who has been in contact with the drug can tell for certain if this is because of the spores of the drug, or if it's because of staring into the eyes of the cactus themselves. There is some question of whether or not this causes sharing of DNA between people. The entry point of the drug is to look into it's eyes and then the eyes coalesce into another person's eyes - when one looks away they are on the shared delusional space known as the Pine Winter Zone from <a href='/html/Past Writing Fragments.html'/>the stream of consciousness writing</a>. What's important to note here is that while the characters are on drugs they continue to act in the science fiction world as if all the old rules still applied so they don't, for example, step out of an airlock. The appeal of the fantasy world is that it's seemingly safer (you don't have to pay for air) and the dead become writers so you can visit people who've died again (or can you? the people that are on drugs are unreliable narrators).   ^eb2958<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Thermofungi</span> - An innovation that is used in spaceship hulls and ships, thermofungi lives off carbon dioxide, dead skin, other human waste products, and sometimes gamma rays in order to passively climate control spaceships. This is also used in spacesuits. ^0cc88b<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Medicuana</span> - Following the Gestalt Diaspora there was a period of experimentation with marijuana and the mind-body problem following psychogenic drift (a host of symptoms that caused real illness in part to psychosomatic components). Most current medicines are grown rather than manufactured and are given in a smokable form. This is not always marijuana, although the term medical marijuana soon translated to medicuana. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Cloned Organs / Limbs</span> - Certain organs and limbs can be cloned, but <br/><h1><br/> The Spacer Test<br/></h1><br/>The spacer test is a test to determine if someone is safe enough to have in a space station, lagrange point, or other places of common culture. Given that refueling and trade happens at these places if someone doesn't pass the spacer test they put their entire crew at risk. Let alone not being allowed to dock with other major ships and stations. The test is administered by registered (ie MGMT approved by station, lagrange point, city ship, or gravity well) gestalts. The spacer test checks for the following conditions. <br/>	- whether or not someone has devolved into a grunter<br/>	- whether or not someone has become a fungal biologic<br/>	- whether or not someone has developed gestalt confusion<br/>	- whether or not someone has developed space madness<br/>	- whether or not someone has a AI madness.<br/>	- whether or not someone has a working space suit<br/>	- whether or not someone has enough credits to pay for air/water/space<br/>While relationships between known space syndicates tends to be rather informal, this is still taken seriously by all but pirate crews or those that have been infected by a disease. The test is conducted in what is known as a <span style='font-weight: bold;'>docking skip</span> that transfers people between a spaceship in parking orbit around a station and the station itself. The skip relies only on ion propulsion and is open to hard vacuum requiring spacesuits. A gestalt theorist conducts a verbal test on crew members one at a time while biologics are tested for and scanned by a medical officer. A crew member checks to see if everyone has the necessary credits. If anyone is liable to have space madness or a non-working space suit this is immediately evident.<br/>- What happens when the test fails? There should be a whole section on this - part of a story arc?<br/><h1><br/> Gestalt Technologies<br/></h1><h1><br/> Ecological Technologies<br/></h1><h1><br/> Diseases<br/></h1><br/>Following the Gestalt Diaspora there have been a number of diseases that are the direct result of technology. <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Gestalt Confusion</span> - One of the weird things about androids and gestalts is that their psychological profile are closely similar. Robots map of what they can and cannot due and gestalt's sundering are such that while an outside observer or even a brain scan may be able to detect the difference between a gestalt or a robot, from a subjective view of the gestalt/robot this is unknown. All that they know is that they are different. This becomes all the more complicated as the question is, what do they do in that situation? Do they trust a syndicate, an order, a gestalt cluster or android hive? <br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Space Madness</span> - A catch all term for someone that has been alone in space away from people so long that they become completely subjective. There are typically subjective/objective tests in order to pass whether someone has succumbed to space madness. See <a href='/html/Religion.html'/>the Void Star religion</a>.<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>AI Hypnotic Madness</span> - Both human beings and androids are susceptible to hypnotism and hypnotics in AI communications. AIs are orders of magnitude more intelligence than human beings and so are masters of manipulation, deceipt and logical reasoning. Given that they do not live or die in the same way that human beings do and consider androids to be nodes they hold the same belief for human beings as well. AIs have been considered to be like children burning ants with a magnifying glass; while a child may have gut bacteria he doesn't consider the ants to be any more worthy of life than he is. All communications have to be passed through and relayed across relay ships that contain cleaning equipment to filter out any metaprogrammatic hidden messages. The <a href='/html/Spaceships.html'/>Anastasia Zirkov</a> is one of the relay ships on a shipping lane owned by MGMT.<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Life Support Failure Disease</span> - Any disease that comes from a combination of failure by life support systems. Radiation mutations leading to DNA damage from either culture death of <a href='/html/Technologies.html'/>thermofungi</a>, or failure of fission reactors and radiation leakage. Oxygen deprivation or failure of the onboard biologics to provide adequate nutrition.<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Fungal Biologics</span> - There are a host of known diseases in space that are caused when spacers "merge" with biological systems. Ecologists are known to experiment on themselves in order to develop the most advanced possible biologics, and it is not uncommon for someone to become something more, or less, biologically human. There isn't any known way for someone to replace the human system with augmentation that is considered an improvement over biological systems (so called <span style='font-weight: bold;'>cyborgs</span>) as compared to biological improvements in people. These biological improvements are considered generally to be improvements in either hardiness to working conditions in space or to augmentations of a person's map. So called <span style='font-weight: bold;'>fungal biologics</span> is a catch all term for ecologists that have become more plant than person or are addicted to illicit pharmabiologicals that cause this condition. These people are thrown out of an air lock on sight.<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Grunting</span> - No one knows why people become grunters although there are some hypothesis. It could be a kind of prion disease like toxomoplasmosis. It could be a result of life support failure and space madness. There may be other reasons. In all likelihood it's a syndrome with multiple causes.</div>
