<div style = 'background: lightgreen; margin: -10px; padding: 20px; max-width: calc(100% - 10px);<br/>    min-height:1000px;'><br/>Here is where all the writing of the story will be written in order. <br/><br/>NOTE - ALL WRITING THAT IS NOT A LEAF OF THIS TABLE OF CONTENTS ARE NOTES, ANY WRITING THAT IS A LEAF OF THIS TABLE OF CONTENTS IS CONSIDERED STORY<br/><br/><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Note - I have to be careful not to re-enact the story arc from Star Wars! Or Tolkien!</span><br/>There should be the concept of story threads. Emi will be one story thread, there will be a couple of vignettes of exposition to describe parts of the solar system (which may or may not connect), and then there will be another story thread that's focusing on another character (on the Anastasia Zirkov) - that focuses on Donal Entori. <br/>There have to be places to explain the space battles - <br/>	One of them will be a flashback experienced on a skip between ships<br/>	One of them will be in a dream sequence that makes someone sympathize with a villain<br/>	One of them will be in the boardroom scene when calculating trajectories<br/>	Only one of them will be a traditional space battle (let that be near the end with a heroic ending action scene)<br/><br/>All writing will be strictly linked in order of the content of the story. Any breaking of writing into chapters may come later. <br/><br/><span style='font-style: italic;'>Explanation of Sci-fi Concept</span> - <span style='font-style: italic;'>Technological concepts are explained in terms of found documents (<a href='/html/Books.html'/>Similar to Dune</a></span>) <a href='/html/Explanation 1.html'/>Explanation 1</a><br/><span style='font-style: italic;'>Media Res Action Sequence</span> - <span style='font-style: italic;'>This scene should be from the point of view of <a href='/html/Characters.html'/>Emi</a> </span> - <a href='/html/Scene 1.html'/>Scene 1</a> ^0b34e8<br/>Here Emi is shot out of an airlock and bounces from satellite to satellite following some sort of conspiracy on Phobos (which will be important to the plot later). She then bounces from satellite to satellite and picks up enormous amounts of velocity before blacking out. (High climax here. Make the character as likable as possible. There should be several pages of how she likes people in the story). Emi shouldn't work for MGMT, she should be "officially" working for Mars Courier (or some such) which is a loose syndicate of transporters for documents and so on.<br/><br/><span style='font-style: italic;'>Explanation of Sci-fi Concept</span> - <span style='font-style: italic;'>There should be an explanation on the credit system according to MGMT</span> <a href='/html/Explanation 2.html'/>Explanation 2</a> <br/>There should be some sort of low tempo story here that involves mining or something else. What would there be? It has to be an expository piece that describes operations on one of the planets. It should introduce a character that we shouldn't like at all. And it should have a marital dispute. It should be from the perspective of what life is like for people that are in their middle age, divorce, etc. There should be something here about a guy just doing his job and running the operation in order to make things work out and start a family and so forth. Not a cop. Works for MGMT, but not a bad person per se.<br/><br/><span style='font-style: italic;'>Explanation of Sci-fi/Battle Concept Here</span> - <span style='font-style: italic;'>There should be an explanation on how gravitational fighting between spaceships works</span> <a href='/html/Explanation 3.html'/>Explanation 3</a><br/>One scene - A plan for a battle around a table where people are discussing orbital trajectories. How are these characters going to be related to the main characters as already introduced? Which characters are important here and which aren't?<br/>Another scene in the same chapter - There should be someone that is coming up through the battle scene (Janie) that is going to end up slingshotting across the bow of a Third Armada Cruiser. <br/><br/><span style='font-style: italic;'>Explanation of Sci-fi Concept Here</span> -  <a href='/html/Explanation 3.html'/>Explanation 3</a><br/>Some other scene<br/>Anastasia Zirkov Scene here - Set up how long the cruiser will be running for and how long. Introduce the characters and a central dilemma - that is the probable mission of the ship and why it's out on patrol. <br/><br/><span style='font-style: italic;'>Pine Winter Zone</span> - <span style='font-style: italic;'>There Should be an explanation of some exposition from the Pine Winter Zone</span> <a href='/html/Explanation 4.html'/>Explanation 4</a> <br/>(In this section the Pine Winter Zone will have a scene without any explanation - computer program scene) and then this will be tied into the novel later.

There are only the two of them onboard. They then have to go on to some other location and do something else. Where do they go and why? What happens is what amounts to a miracle in space and so this will have massive implications for what it means for Janie (let's say that he's older and rediscovers faith or something) and Emi who doesn't quite know what it means. There's only the two of them, so this will be a weird interaction and I don't know what I should do here. What's the orbital velocity of the vessel and what information did Emi pick up that will direct the story?<br/><br/><span style='font-style: italic;'>Explanation of Sci-fi Concept/Gestalt Dream? Here</span> - <span style='font-style: italic;'></span> <a href='/html/Explanation 5.html'/>Explanation 5</a><br/>Anastasia Zirkov Scene here - Someone remembers a battle and then wakes up from the dream and then in reality their life mirrors the dream. This should have a set up with rising action that then segways to another section of the novel after setting up a problem onboard. Given that they're a radio transmission ship they should pick up the signal from Emi and Jani. Meanwhile the stoway onboard is the ecologist who is creating this mushroom drug who himself is about to be found out. <br/><br/><span style='font-style: italic;'>Pine Winter Zone</span> - <span style='font-style: italic;'></span> <a href='/html/Explanation 5.html'/>Explanation 5</a><br/>There's another scene here in the Pine Winter Zone. What should the scene be? <br/><br/><span style='font-style: italic;'>Explanation of Sci-fi Concept - Another explanation of a battle scene</span> - <span style='font-style: italic;'></span> <a href='/html/Explanation 6.html'/>Explanation 6</a><br/>This is a long section - <br/><br/>They pick up Emi and Jani and then there's a pirate battle that they come across. So there needs to be a docking and boarding sequence with Emi and Jani, and then there needs to be a pirate battle at almost the same time.<br/><br/>Here's the sequence of events - <br/><br/>Pick up Emi and Jani and lock them up. <br/><br/>There's some dramatic explanation of what's happening with the crew members. That isn't related to the the ecologist. Here the crew members are discussing some interpersonal relationship while in the background they pick up a signal that ends up becoming the space battle.<br/><br/>The hull is hit, several of the crew members are killed, but the MGMT (villain?), Emi, Jani, and the ecologist all manage to commandeer/board/are taken prisoner not on the AZ nor Jani's ship, but some other ship from the pirate battle. What is this ship like and why? <br/><br/><br/>What makes a happy ending to the story? I don't think there will be an ending as such that is "happy", but there will be some conclusion in some way...</div>
